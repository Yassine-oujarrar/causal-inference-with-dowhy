# causal-inference-with-dowhy
This repository contains a practical project on causal inference. It includes data visualization tasks, the comparison of causal discovery algorithms (Notears vs. Dowhy), and an analysis of their effectiveness in identifying causal relationships. The project demonstrates the application of causal inference techniques, focusing on education, income, and health variables. In the first part, linear data is used, where education affects income and income affects health. In the second part, non-linear data involving trigonometric functions (cos, sin) is used, introducing more complex relationships between the variables.
